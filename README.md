Crypto Clustering
In this analysis, we examine cryptocurrencies by assessing their performance over the past 24 hours and 7 days using historical data. To prepare the data, I utilized the StandardScaler from scikit-learn to normalize the dataset. Next, I worked within Jupyter Notebook to determine the optimal k-value for clustering using the scaled DataFrame.

Once the best k-value was identified, I applied the K-Means algorithm to categorize cryptocurrencies into clusters and visualized the results with a scatter plot. Following this, I performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dataset to three principal components, simplifying the data while retaining essential trends. I then repeated the clustering process using the PCA-transformed data and compared the results to evaluate the effectiveness of both approaches.
